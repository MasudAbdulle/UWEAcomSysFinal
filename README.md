Accommodation System (NetBeans 8.2)
This Accommodation System is a Java application developed using JavaFX and Scene Builder to create a dynamic system that manages accommodation information. The system provides different views and functionalities for different user roles and is designed to work specifically with NetBeans version 8.2.

Features
Master View: This view allows the user to change the price and availability of the rooms. The master view is typically used by the management team or administrators.

Hall Master View: The hall master view has limited access and can only change the clean value of the rooms. It is designed for users responsible for maintaining the cleanliness of the rooms.

Building Officer View: The building officer view allows users to update the room's price and occupancy status. This view is suitable for staff responsible for managing room availability.

Dynamic Table: The system uses JavaFX's TableView component to display accommodation data in a dynamic table. The table provides an easy-to-read and organized representation of room information.

Requirements
To run the Accommodation System, you need to have the following:

Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your system.
JavaFX libraries.
NetBeans version 8.2 or compatible IDE.
How to Run
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open NetBeans 8.2 or a compatible IDE.
Import the project into the IDE.
Compile and run the Main.java class.
Usage
Upon running the application, the user will be presented with a login screen where they can select their appropriate role (Master, Hall Master, or Building Officer). Depending on the selected role, the user will be redirected to the corresponding view.

In each view, the user can interact with the dynamic table to change the price, availability, or clean value of the rooms. Changes made in one view will be reflected in real-time for other users as well, ensuring a synchronized and up-to-date accommodation system.

Contribution
This project was completed as part of my coursework for university. It showcases my skills and knowledge in Java development, JavaFX, and Scene Builder. As a solo developer for this coursework, I was responsible for conceptualizing, designing, and implementing the Accommodation System.
