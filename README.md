# UWEAcomSysFinal
The UWE Acomodation system is an app that allows users to manager activites like adding leases, deleting leases, cleaning rooms and view room details depending on what
access the user has. 
There are three different levels of user Warden, Manager and Super user. 
The manager can view room details and add and delete leases.
The warden has access to only one hall and can update cleaning status.
The super user can do all of the activites of the warden and manager combined.
I created this system using objected oriented programming and to implement the user interface I used scene builder.
