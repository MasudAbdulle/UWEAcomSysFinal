# UWEAcomSysFinal
Strategy Planning: 
Phase 1: 
To initiate our Strategy planning for phase 1 we produced an epic to help us 
visualise where we wanted to be at the end of the development phase (Phase 1). 
The below epic breaks down the task of modelling the UWE Bristol Accommodation 
System into three manageable stories. 
EPIC: MODEL UWE BRISTOL ACCOMMODATION 
SYSTEM
Story 1: Produce 
Use Case Diagram
Story 2: Produce 
Class Diagram 
Story 3: Produce 
Sequence 
Diagram 
During the strategy planning we developed UML Diagrams to model how the system 
should function and who the main actors were. 
Story 1: Produce Use Case Diagram
The first model, the use case diagram, detailed how the system users interacted with 
the system. During this phase we thoroughly studied the system requirements and 
concluded that the System Users were the Warden and the Hall Manager. We 
discarded Students as this group had no real interaction with the system.

In a nutshell, here is the backlog of activities we did to accomplish Story 1: 
1. Read system requirements 
2. Identify users 
3. Identify Use Cases 
4. Identify relationships between users and use cases 
5. Produce UML User Case Diagram 
Story 2: Produce Class Diagram 
Once we had identified who the users were the next stage in our strategy planning 
was to develop the classes the system would hold. This stage required analysis of 
the requirements to understand how objects were to be contained in classes. 
Additionally, we had to pay special attention to how these classes were related to 
each other, and their cardinality. This step took the team close to three weeks to 
complete due to its complexity, and number of details (methods, attributes, 
relationships, cardinalities...) 
Since it was a very detailed Class Diagram, it represented our first concept of how 
our UWE Bristol Accommodation System would look like when implemented. This 
was an important step since without this, we would have potentially not fully 
understood the system requirements when implementing the code and would have 
reduced our productivity as a team due to the shortcoming during this phase.

In a nutshell, here is the backlog of activities we did to accomplish Story 2: 
1. Read system requirements 
2. Identify objects

3. Identify classes 
4. Identify relationships between users and use cases 
5. Produce UML User Class Diagram 
Story 3: Produce Sequence Diagram
The final stage of our modelling of the UWE Accommodation System, was to model 
how objects and classes behaved to satisfy the user needs in a sequence diagram. 
Due to being three different users (Super User, Hall Manager and Warden) the team 
elaborated at least three Sequence diagram to show how classes, and objects 
should interact to satisfy the customer needs.

In a nutshell, here is the backlog of activities we did to accomplish Story 3: 
1. Identify affected classes 
2. Identify affected objects 
3. Identify methods being used 
4. Identify relationships between user, methods, and classes 
5. Produce UML Sequence Diagram

Phase 2: 
To initiate our Strategy planning for phase 2 we produced an epic to help us 
visualise where we wanted to be at the end of the implementation phase (Phase 2). 
The below epic breaks down the task of implementing the UWE Bristol 
Accommodation System into three manageable stories. 
EPIC: IMPLEMENT UWE BRISTOL ACCOMMODATION 
SYSTEM
Story 1: 
Implement classes 
Story 2: Add data 
to the UWE 
Accommodation 
System to feed the 
GUI
Story 3: Produce 
GUI 
Story 1: Implement classes 
The first stage in the implementation process was to implement the different classes 
that were modelled during the development phase. 
For each class we implemented the methods, attributes and constructures that were 
identified in the class diagram. The image below shows a snapshot from the Lease 
class.

In a nutshell, here is the backlog of activities we did to accomplish Story 1: 
1. Create UWE Accommodation package in Netbean 8.2 
2. Create as many files as classes we identified 
3. Populate classes with methods, attributes, and constructor. 
4. Classes fully implemented
Story 2: Add data to the UWE Accommodation System to feed the GUI
The next step into the UWE Accommodation System was to add the data that would 
be used by the GUI to display it in our UWE Bristol Accommodation System 
Application. This process was mainly accomplished by creating objects. 
Figure 5 Data to feed the UWE Accommodation System GUI 
In a nutshell, here is the backlog of activities we did to accomplish Story 2: 
1. Create object Classes 
2. Create FXML File for Login, Warden, Hall Manager and Super User. 
3. Debug code if errors are found 
4. Data fully implemented
Story 3: Produce GUI
For this we made use of scene builder which allowed us to be more efficient when 
creating the GUI.

In a nutshell, here is the backlog of activities we did to accomplish Story 3: 
1. Create GUI Interface using SceneBuilder 
2. Connect objects with GUI 
3. Test the GUI 
Continuous team iterations: 
Our time used the Agile Dev Methodology whereby the development is split into a 
series of iterations. To work on both development and implementation phases in an 
efficient manner as a team, we agreed to work in iterations of 2 weeks where we 
committed to complete tasks from the project backlog. These iterations are also 
known as Sprints. 
For every sprint we planned what outcome should be accomplished by the end of 
this time, we were holding almost daily meetings to monitor where we were in the 
sprint, and every Monday during the OOSD2 Practical we were having a sprint 
review to retrospectively assess how we performed during the Sprint. 
Using iterative development allowed us to have a working version of the application 
at the end of each sprint.

Team communication:
To enable effective communication between team members, we from the beginning 
of the project created a Microsoft Teams group to organise online meetings, and to 
store documents, source code, models, and other relevant information to our project, 
also to facilitate day-to-day communication, and for when we were unable to meet 
face-to-face, we created a WhatsApp Group to update each other on our progress 
for each sprint, and to highlight risks or other issues related to the project. 
The usage of these communications tools above allowed us to be flexible and meet 
at times that would suit everyone with minimum effort.

Simplicity: 
Since we are using the Object-Oriented System Development, we were able to 
benefit from the Modularity OOSD offers this allowed us to work at the same time in 
different classes, and objects and minimizing duplication. 
Another benefit that contributed to the simplicity of using OOSD was the reusability 
of code through inheritance. For example, the Super User relation with the warden 
and Hall Manager. 
Finally, OOSD allows for effective problem solving as if needed we can break 
down chunks of code to easily solve any related issues with it. 
Work Plan 
The following Work Plan was done with Microsoft Projects, and it shows the two 
parts of the assignment each one including three sprints, and each sprint shows the 
backlog of activities needed to accomplish each sprint.
